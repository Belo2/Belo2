About Me
I am a self-taught web developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro. While I haven't worked professionally as a developer yet, I have a passion for programming and enjoy learning new technologies. In my free time, I like to hit the gym, play online games, and spend time with friends and family.

My Projects
You can find all of my projects in my GitHub repository. While I don't have any major projects yet, I've worked on a number of small projects that showcase my skills in web development. These include a responsive portfolio website, a simple weather app using the OpenWeatherMap API, and a small React app that allows users to search for GIFs using the GIPHY API.
